In Progress: a restaurant review site specifically for restaurants at Walt Disney World parks and resorts.  Version 1 (MVP) is completed as of 10/15/18, and I'll be implementing functionality and style improvements before I launch the app.

Next step in the process will be a large-scale refactor to clean up some of the code, which I'm expecting to spend at least 10 hours on.
